# Welcome to Eric's Adventures in Programming

## About me
* I am a SPED ELA and budding Computer Science teacher who has taught across a variety of settings in my 11 years as an educator. 
* I began teaching self-contained Special Education at [John Adams High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_High_School_(Queens)) in [Ozone Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_Park,_Queens), Queens.  
* I then rode the  Coteaching wave with my Generalist license to co-teach ELA, Global History, Math, [Earth Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic), and others for Senior Academy, a section of John Adams focused on serving over-aged and under-credited students.  
* I am now in my 7th year teaching mostly ELA at [Brooklyn Frontiers High School](https://insideschools.org/school/15K423), a [transfer high school](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/other-ways-to-graduate/transfer-high-schools) in Downtown Brooklyn.  
* Pre-pandini I started and coached a bsketball team and had the privilege of getting absolutely slapped in the [2018 Multiple Pathways league Finals](https://www.psal.org/games/game-detail.aspx#049/371941) at Queens College :,-( [<img src="https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/640x360/p04ktjn2.jpg">](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/640x360/p04ktjn2.jpg)
