## About me
* I am a SPED ELA and budding Computer Science teacher who has taught across a variety of settings in my 11 years as an educator. 
* I began teaching self-contained Special Education at [John Adams High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_High_School_(Queens)) in [Ozone Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_Park,_Queens), Queens.  
* I then rode the  Coteaching wave with my Generalist license to co-teach ELA, Global History, Math, [Earth Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_erratic), and others for Senior Academy, a section of John Adams focused on serving over-aged and under-credited students.  
* I am now in my 7th year teaching mostly ELA at [Brooklyn Frontiers High School](https://insideschools.org/school/15K423), a [transfer high school](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/other-ways-to-graduate/transfer-high-schools) in Downtown Brooklyn.  
* Pre-pandini I started and coached a bsketball team and had the privilege of getting absolutely slapped in the [2018 Multiple Pathways league Finals](https://www.psal.org/games/game-detail.aspx#049/371941) at Queens College :,-( [<img src="https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/640x360/p04ktjn2.jpg">](https://ichef.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/640x360/p04ktjn2.jpg)

## Programming in Java
** This class was one of the most challenging things I have ever done in my life.  Throughout most of my academic career I have enjoyed being proficient at the classes that I was taking and near the top of my class.  Programming in Java was a MAJOR exception. For the first time in a long time I felt like I was a total novice and incapable of bringing much to my groupwork beyond enthusiasm and curiosity.  Thankfully, in addition to being absolutely brilliant, my group peers were always acommodating and patient with me as they helped me learn the material.  This experience has been incredibly fulfilling for me as I have the chance to experience what many of my students must feel in my class sometimes!

## Data Structrues
* Data Structuers picked up where Java left off in terms of having me feel like I was learning a totally new language and way of thinking.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the chance to take a peek at some of the structures and strategies that programmers use to organize, traverse, and analyze data.  Again I have been reliant on the brilliance and kindness of my peers and professors to help me get up to speed!


## Methods I
* As a computer science department of 1 at my school, this has been perhaps the most valuable and relevant class towards actually teaching computer science.  The learning has continued here as I have begun my adventure learning Markdown langauge in addition to strategizing teaching methods with my friends.
